New facts reveal how Congress callously gave away #Katchatheevu.
The focus on Katchatheevu kills several birds with one stone for the BJP.
In his post on Monday, Modi said the Congress and DMK “only care that their own sons and daughters rise”.

Katchatheevu: How a tiny island became major flashpoint in Tamil Nadu politics,"PM Modi’s allegations were based on documents obtained through an RTI application by Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai.
The DMK was in power in Tamil Nadu when the Indira Gandhi government recognised Sri Lankan sovereignty over the island.
With the Katchatheevu issue, the BJP may be trying to convey the message that is aligned with the local issues of Tamil Nadu.
With the BJP and its allies eyeing 400 seats in the Lok Sabha polls, Tamil Nadu becomes important for the party.

Mint Explainer: What is the controversy over Katchatheevu Island about?,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reignited a longstanding debate in Indian politics by criticizing the Congress party for relinquishing control of the Katchatheevu Island to Sri Lanka in 1974, under Indira Gandhi's leadership.
Katchatheevu is an uninhabited island situated in the Palk Strait, lying between India and Sri Lanka.
Following extensive negotiations that began in the early 20th century, India and Sri Lanka signed a maritime boundary agreement in 1974, assigning the island to Sri Lankan territory.
Media reports alleged DMK's M Karunanidhi's acquiescence in transferring the island to Sri Lanka, despite the party's public stand against such a move.
Over the past 20 years, Sri Lanka has detained 6,184 Indian fishermen and 1,175 fishing vessels, Jaishankar has said.",2024-04-01 16:23:25+05:30,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy93aGF0LWlzLXRoZS1wb2xpdGljYWwtY29udHJvdmVyc3ktb3Zlci1rYXRjaGF0aGVldnUtaXNsYW5kLWFib3V0LTExNzExOTYxMzE0NDkyLmh0bWzSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vcG9saXRpY3Mvd2hhdC1pcy10aGUtcG9saXRpY2FsLWNvbnRyb3ZlcnN5LW92ZXIta2F0Y2hhdGhlZXZ1LWlzbGFuZC1hYm91dC9hbXAtMTE3MTE5NjEzMTQ0OTIuaHRtbA?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen

The Congress has grown closer to the Mandal parties by emphasising the need for a caste census while the Left remains a small but viable political entity in Bihar because of its base among the poor.

Generative AI to quantify uncertainty in weather forecasting,"The importance of accurate and timely weather forecasts will only increase as the climate changes.
SEEDS is a generative AI model that can efficiently generate ensembles of weather forecasts at scale at a small fraction of the cost of traditional physics-based forecasting models.

"'Appalling and insulting': Trump campaign slams Biden for declaring March 31, Easter Sunday, as transgender day of visibility","NEW Delhi: The Trump campaign and other Republican leaders attacked US President Joe Biden for declaring Easter Sunday as the transgender day of visibility .On Friday, the US president, in a statement, said, ""Now, therefore, I, Joseph R Biden jr., president of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 31, 2024, as Transgender Day of Visibility.I call upon all Americans to join us in lifting up the lives and voices of transgender people throughout our Nation and to work toward eliminating violence and discrimination based on gender identity.

Penny stocks, trading at low prices, often below ₹10 per share in the Indian market, represent shares of small companies with low market capitalisation.

The Life and Death of Mukhtar Ansari,"With his towering frame and a thick twirled-up moustache, Mukhtar Ansari stood apart from other legislators whenever he walked down the hallowed corridors of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, the only place he could make full-fledged public appearances since being jailed in 2005.

But over the last seven years, since the Bharatiya Janata Party government came to power in the state, it metamorphosed into a tale of selective state vendetta and punishment of a powerful Muslim political family to appease the cynical pits of majoritarian sentiments.

LDP Seen Punishing 39 People over Money Scandal,"Newsfrom JapanTokyo, April 1 (Jiji Press)--Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party is seen punishing 39 people, mostly party lawmakers, over a high-profile money scandal involving LDP factions, it was learned Monday.
LDP Secretary-General Toshimitsu Motegi asked the party's ethics committee on the day to review the 39, who were senior members of factions once led by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and former LDP Secretary-General Toshihiro Nikai, or who failed to report 5 million yen or more in political funds for five recent years.
The people in question do not include Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, president of the LDP, or Nikai, who has announced that he will not run in the next House of Representatives election.
""We aim to adopt a punishment policy this week,"" Motegi told a press conference on Monday.

"LDP eyes punishing members over scandal, leaves out Kishida","Some or all of the four members of the Abe faction may face the punishment of being advised to leave the party -- the second-severest in its eight levels of penalties following expulsion.
Kishida, meanwhile, who doubles as LDP president, said earlier that he himself would not be subject to penalties given that his faction, unlike the Abe and Nikai groups, did not pass back money to members.
About 40 other members who also had not properly reported their political funds will not be examined by the ethics committee but will be issued ""a warning"" not to repeat such acts, Motegi said.
The Kishida, Abe and Nikai factions have decided to disband in the wake of the scandal.

Kobayashi Pharmaceutical is among many firms that utilize the kinōsei hyōji shokuhin label, or Foods with Function Claims (FFC).

F1 Q&A: Andrew Benson answers your questions after Australian GP,"Andrew: It's not for me to say what the F1 rules should be, but I can tell you that there is no appetite among F1 stakeholders for a 'tyre war', as it is known when there is more than one tyre supplier in competition.
The Pirelli tyres supplied to F1 are most unlike what might be called a typical racing tyre, in that they are very thermally sensitive, and typically require gentle treatment to prevent them overheating.
And it's not how the tyres behave in other categories where Pirelli is not the supplier, for example in endurance racing or IndyCars.

The source said Shaheen was disappointed that he was not kept in loop as PCB chief held discussions with the national selectors and Babar Azam this week to discuss the T20 World Cup, appointment of coaches and captaincy.
Shaheen was named T20 captain after the World Cup in India last November when Zaka Ashraf was heading the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).

Sri Narayana Guru forum to support Billava candidates irrespective of political parties: Sathyajith Surathkal,"Mangaluru: Hindu activist and Sri Narayana Guru Vichara Vedike (SNGV) state president Sathyajith Surathkal said that the SNGV will support Billava candidates in the Lok Sabha election without looking at the party affiliation.
Accordingly, the forum will support the candidature of Padmaraj R (Congress) from Dakshina Kannada, Kota Srinivas Poojary (BJP) from Udupi-Chikmagalur and Geetha Shivaraj Kumar (Congress) from Shimoga.
The forum will not support any political party and instead will support the candidates from the Billava community, thereby work towards the social, educational and economic progress of the community, Surathkal told mediapersons in Mangaluru.

""Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar seems to have thought Vidhana Soudha was a Congress office.
On March 30, Sivakumar violated the Election Code of Conduct by organising Najma Nazeer Chikkanerale's induction into the Congress party, at the Vidhana Soudha office,"" BJP said in a statement.
It accused Shivakumar of defying the code of conduct by organising a political programme at the government office, despite being aware that it should not be done.

Democratic backsliding in India is every political party’s doing,"Plus, it has more resources and tools to tilt the playing field in its favour.
Can we call opposition parties more democratic than the BJP and NDA partners?
Then there are first-generation single-person parties like TMC, BSP and AAP.All these parties are likely to ultimately distort the democratic field in the long run.
""Dynastic, non-democratic parties can only “cry wolf” about democratic backsliding in India.
