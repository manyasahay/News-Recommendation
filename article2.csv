Katchatheevu: How a tiny island became major flashpoint in Tamil Nadu politics,"PM Modi’s allegations were based on documents obtained through an RTI application by Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai.

Bakhle explained that her book was an attempt to simultaneously analyse and to link Savarkar’s local, national, and global roles.
“In the revolutionary world, Savarkar was either a revolutionary nationalist or a revolutionary terrorist—as the British saw him—or he was just this inspirational patriot.
And then there was the Savarkar in Maharashtra,” where he was known as a poet, author, and anti-caste advocate, said Bakhle.",2024-03-31 23:55:20+05:30,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmRpYS1uZXdzL3VucmF2ZWxsaW5nLXNhdmFya2FyLXMtaW1wYWN0LW9uLXBvbGl0aWNzLWlkZW9sb2dpY2FsLXRob3VnaHQtMTAxNzExOTA5NTIwNzM4Lmh0bWzSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL2luZGlhLW5ld3MvdW5yYXZlbGxpbmctc2F2YXJrYXItcy1pbXBhY3Qtb24tcG9saXRpY3MtaWRlb2xvZ2ljYWwtdGhvdWdodC0xMDE3MTE5MDk1MjA3MzgtYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen,unravelling savarkar ’ impact politics ideological thought,today ’ india historical figure whose writing thinking help explain current ideological zeitgeist vinayak damodar savarkar savarkar certainly hindu champion also anti-caste progressive pioneering advocate woman ’ right patriotic poet bakhle explained book attempt simultaneously analyse link savarkar ’ local national global role “ revolutionary world savarkar either revolutionary nationalist revolutionary terrorist—as british saw him—or inspirational patriot savarkar maharashtra ” known poet author anti-caste advocate said bakhle,3

Malefactors and misgivings: On the Congress and the INDIA bloc,"The other large national party, the Congress, has a nation-wide presence but is handicapped by severe weaknesses in quite a few States, which it seeks to overcome through State-wise alliances.
These alliances benefit the regional parties that are also finding it increasingly difficult to tackle the BJP on their own.
The INDIA bloc (Congress, regional parties and the Left) remains a selective State-wise alliance that is determined by the need for unity against the BJP.
The Congress has grown closer to the Mandal parties by emphasising the need for a caste census while the Left remains a small but viable political entity in Bihar because of its base among the poor.

‘Eye opening’: PM Modi lashes out at Congress for giving away Katchatheevu island to Sri Lanka,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday lashed out at the Congress party over a controversial island, Katchatheevu that was given to Sri Lanka by former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1974.
The Katchatheevu island debate has taken centre stage in Tamil Nadu politics as the Lok Sabha election nears.
The Raja enjoyed rights in Katchatheevu island from 875 to 1948 which later got vested in the State of Madras after the abolition of the Zamindari system.
India's then foreign secretary Kewal Singh emphasised that Sri Lanka had shown records that the island was part of the kingdom of Jaffnapatnam, Dutch and British maps.

Why PM Modi has raised the emotive Katchatheevu Island issue,"Leading this BJP attack, Prime Minister Narendra Modi cited a media report to assert that the Congress “callously” gave away the Katchatheevu Island to Sri Lanka.
“The president of BJP’s Tamil Nadu unit files an RTI query to create a diversionary issue in Tamil Nadu.

Why India’s elites back Narendra Modi,"N arendra Modi , India’s prime minister, is often lumped together with right-wing populists such as Donald Trump or Viktor Orban.
Rather, Mr Modi said, he pulled himself up through “45 years of toil”.

The Life and Death of Mukhtar Ansari,"With his towering frame and a thick twirled-up moustache, Mukhtar Ansari stood apart from other legislators whenever he walked down the hallowed corridors of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, the only place he could make full-fledged public appearances since being jailed in 2005.
Two incidents — a riot and a murder — that took place that year continued to haunt his life and political career till his death under suspicious circumstances on 28 March 2024.
The Mukhtar story is indeed about the foul criminal-political nexus in East UP, where feudalism, caste loyalties, business interests and political ambition converged to form a lethal cocktail of bloodshed, retribution, and polarisation.
But over the last seven years, since the Bharatiya Janata Party government came to power in the state, it metamorphosed into a tale of selective state vendetta and punishment of a powerful Muslim political family to appease the cynical pits of majoritarian sentiments.

The people in question do not include Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, president of the LDP, or Nikai, who has announced that he will not run in the next House of Representatives election.

Kishida, meanwhile, who doubles as LDP president, said earlier that he himself would not be subject to penalties given that his faction, unlike the Abe and Nikai groups, did not pass back money to members.
About 40 other members who also had not properly reported their political funds will not be examined by the ethics committee but will be issued ""a warning"" not to repeat such acts, Motegi said.
The Kishida, Abe and Nikai factions have decided to disband in the wake of the scandal.

Japan’s Scandal-Ridden Politics Threaten to Claim Another PM,"Kishida, a soft-spoken former foreign minister with a lackluster image, is already Japan’s second prime minister since Shinzo Abe resigned in 2020 after a unique, nearly eight-year second term that made him the country’s longest-serving premier.

Kobayashi Pharma scandal reignites debate on ‘functional food’ labels,"Kobayashi Pharmaceutical’s growing scandal over its red yeast supplements has reignited debate on Japan’s “functional food” labels, which have been criticized for years over the lack of sufficient scientific proof of safety and efficacy accompanying their use.
The Osaka-based drugmaker on Friday confirmed another death associated with its line of beni kōji red yeast rice dietary supplements, bringing the reported fatality count to five, and the number of hospitalizations to 114.
While the company has yet to pinpoint the cause of the health problems, it has said its beni kōji products may have unintentionally contained a yet-to-be-identified toxic substance.
Kobayashi Pharmaceutical is among many firms that utilize the kinōsei hyōji shokuhin label, or Foods with Function Claims (FFC).

F1 Q&A: Andrew Benson answers your questions after Australian GP,"Andrew: It's not for me to say what the F1 rules should be, but I can tell you that there is no appetite among F1 stakeholders for a 'tyre war', as it is known when there is more than one tyre supplier in competition.
The Pirelli tyres supplied to F1 are most unlike what might be called a typical racing tyre, in that they are very thermally sensitive, and typically require gentle treatment to prevent them overheating.
And it's not how the tyres behave in other categories where Pirelli is not the supplier, for example in endurance racing or IndyCars.
F1 had the opportunity to change tyre suppliers last year, when Bridgestone made a bid to return.
Many people were pushing F1 chairman Stefano Domenicali to make the switch, but in the end he preferred to stick with Pirelli.",,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vc3BvcnQvZm9ybXVsYTEvNjg2NDkzMDTSAS9odHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL3Nwb3J0L2Zvcm11bGExLzY4NjQ5MzA0LmFtcA?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen,f1 q andrew benson answer question australian gp,andrew 's say f1 rule tell appetite among f1 stakeholder 'tyre war known one tyre supplier competition pirelli tyre supplied f1 unlike might called typical racing tyre thermally sensitive typically require gentle treatment prevent overheating 's tyre behave category pirelli supplier example endurance racing indycars f1 opportunity change tyre supplier last year bridgestone made bid return many people pushing f1 chairman stefano domenicali make switch end preferred stick pirelli,0

Democratic backsliding in India is every political party’s doing,"Plus, it has more resources and tools to tilt the playing field in its favour.
Can we call opposition parties more democratic than the BJP and NDA partners?
Then there are first-generation single-person parties like TMC, BSP and AAP.All these parties are likely to ultimately distort the democratic field in the long run.
""Dynastic, non-democratic parties can only “cry wolf” about democratic backsliding in India.
The irony is so apparent here.If India is undergoing a democratic recession, then all key players and parties must share the blame.",,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi_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?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen,democratic backsliding india every political party ’,plus resource tool tilt playing field favour call opposition party democratic bjp nda partner first-generation single-person party like tmc bsp aap.all party likely ultimately distort democratic field long run `` dynastic non-democratic party “ cry wolf ” democratic backsliding india irony apparent here.if india undergoing democratic recession key player party must share blame,4
